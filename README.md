# Skyfall RPG API Structure

This is an API designed to manage all sorts of things for the Skyfall RPG. Initially, i will only create an 'Ability' class, but in the future, there will be equipment, items, spells, and everything else.

The structure of the 'Ability' will look something like this:

## Ability Class
### Attributes of an Ability
*Note: Initially it were meant to be a 'skyfall spells api', but i found out mid way that spells are considered abilities in the system. The attributes marked with an 'X' before it will be inherited by the 'Spells' class when i create it.*
