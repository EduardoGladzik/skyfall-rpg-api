# Skyfall RPG API

This is an API designed to consult various elements of the Brazilian TTRPG, *Skyfall*. Initially, it will handle only Abilities, Spells, and Descriptors.

## Core Concepts

* **Ability:** This is the main class representing general abilities within the game.
* **Spell:** This class **inherits from** Ability, adding specific properties relevant to magic.
* **Descriptor:** These function like "tags" used in the RPG system to convey specific information to the player.

*Currently working on improving the models and implementing the frontend*

When the project is finished, you will be able to filter Abilities and Spells by name, PE cost, level, type, and many other options.
